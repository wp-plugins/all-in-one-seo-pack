Adds META tags like keywords and descriptions to your posts and pages and makes your pages unique.

== Description ==

Adds META tags like keywords and descriptions to your posts and pages and makes your pages unique.

META tags are extracted from your posts/pages like this:

* Your categories become your META keywords.
* Your excerpt is used as META description (put effort into that one, it will pay off).
* Additional custom fields named "keywords" and "description" are taken into account for backwards compatibility with
[Another Wordpress Meta Plugin](http://wp.uberdose.com/2006/11/04/another-wordpress-meta-plugin/).
* Your titles are rewritten. Actual post title comes first, then your blog name. Not the other way round.
* "Filler Pages" like archives and categories are excluded from indexing to avoid duplicate content.
